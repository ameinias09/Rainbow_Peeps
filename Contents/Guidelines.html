        <center>
            <h4>BE CARING</h4><br/> Everyone deserves a place where they can find love and support.<br/><br/><br/>

            <h4>BE WELCOMING</h4><br/> Everyone deserves a place where they can be themselves comfortably.<br/><br/><br/>

            <h4>TREAT OTHERS THE WAY YOU'D LIKE TO BE TREATED</h4><br/> Everyone deserves to be treated with patience and kindness.<br/><br/><br/></center><br/>
        <h5>Don&#39;t demean people or groups</h5><br><br> Don&#39;t do anything that would make this an unwelcoming environment for someone just because of their identity or experiences.<br> Don&#39;t use transphobic, biphobic, homophobic, racist, sexist,
        anti-immigrant, fat-shaming language, or anything else that excludes or demeans marginalized groups. <br>
        <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
            <li> includes everything from slurs to indirect or coded references. </li>
            <li>Avoid starting discussions that you know will hurt someone, or make them feel unwelcome here.</li>
        </ul><br> Don&#39;t invalidate people&#39;s identities, feelings, or experiences. Each of us is the expert of our own experiences; respect that.<br>
        <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
            <li>This includes accusing others of “faking” something, or doing something “just for attention”, and things like that.</li>
            <li>It also includes saying that certain identities don&#39;t belong on TrevorSpace, or that some identities aren&#39;t “valid” or “real” (so don&#39;t say that someone isn&#39;t “really trans” because they have different experiences from you,
                or anything like that). </li>
        </ul><br><br> The above guidelines are not meant to be a 100% complete list of what isn&#39;t allowed on Rainbow Peeps - we consider each situation in context, and things might arise that don&#39;t quite fit into the above list, but that we feel the
        need to act on, in order to preserve the safety and spirit of Rainbow Peeps.<br><br>
